## Description📚
In the following project, part of Geekshubs, the development of an interactive television interface with a remote control is proposed using web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The main goal is to create an intuitive and functional user experience that simulates interaction with a real television.


## Design🖋️

The design of the project consists of an interactive television with a remote control which we can both plug in and turn off the TV and it will show us the date and the supposedly selected channel on the screen.
